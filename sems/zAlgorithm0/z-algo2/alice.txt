Here ! you may nurse it a bit if you like ! the Duchess said to Alice flinging the baby at her as she spoke I must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen and she hurried out of the room The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out but it just missed her
Alice caught the baby with some difficulty as it was a queer-shaped little creature and held out its arms and legs in all directions just like a star-fish thought Alice The poor little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again so that altogether for the first minute or two it was as much as she could do to hold it
As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it which was to twist it up into a sort of knot and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot so as to prevent its undoing itself she carried it out into the open air If I don’t take this child away with me thought Alice they’re sure to kill it in a day or two wouldn’t it be murder to leave it behind ? She said the last words out loud and the little thing grunted in reply it had left off sneezing by this time Don’t grunt said Alice that’s not at all a proper way of expressing yourself
The baby grunted again and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it There could be no doubt that it had a very turn-up nose much more like a snout than a real nose also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at all But perhaps it was only sobbing she thought and looked into its eyes again to see if there were any tears
No there were no tears If you’re going to turn into a pig my dear said Alice seriously I’ll have nothing more to do with you Mind now ! The poor little thing sobbed again or grunted it was impossible to say which and they went on for some while in silence
Alice was just beginning to think to herself Now what am I to do with this creature when I get it home ? when it grunted again so violently that she looked down into its face in some alarm This time there could be no mistake about it it was neither more nor less than a pig and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further
So she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood If it had grown up she said to herself it would have made a dreadfully ugly child but it makes rather a handsome pig I think And she began thinking over other children she knew who might do very well as pigs and was just saying to herself if one only knew the right way to change them when she was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off
The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice It looked good-natured she thought still it had very long claws and a great many teeth so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect
Cheshire Puss she began rather timidly as she did not at all know whether it would like the name however it only grinned a little wider Come it’s pleased so far thought Alice and she went on Would you tell me please which way I ought to go from here ?
That depends a good deal on where you want to get to said the Cat
I don’t much care where said Alice
Then it doesn’t matter which way you go said the Cat
so long as I get somewhere Alice added as an explanation
Oh you’re sure to do that said the Cat if you only walk long enough
Alice felt that this could not be denied so she tried another question What sort of people live about here ?
In that direction the Cat said waving its right paw round lives a Hatter and in that direction waving the other paw lives a March Hare Visit either you like they’re both mad
But I don’t want to go among mad people Alice remarked
Oh you can’t help that said the Cat we’re all mad here I’m mad You’re mad
How do you know I’m mad ? said Alice
You must be said the Cat or you wouldn’t have come here
Alice didn’t think that proved it at all however she went on And how do you know that you’re mad ?
To begin with said the Cat a dog’s not mad You grant that ?
I suppose so said Alice
Well then the Cat went on you see a dog growls when it’s angry and wags its tail when it’s pleased Now I growl when I’m pleased and wag my tail when I’m angry Therefore I’m mad
I call it purring not growling said Alice
Call it what you like said the Cat Do you play croquet with the Queen to-day ?
I should like it very much said Alice but I haven’t been invited yet
You’ll see me there said the Cat and vanished
Alice was not much surprised at this she was getting so used to queer things happening While she was looking at the place where it had been it suddenly appeared again
By-the-bye what became of the baby ? said the Cat I’d nearly forgotten to ask
It turned into a pig Alice quietly said just as if it had come back in a natural way
I thought it would said the Cat and vanished again
Alice waited a little half expecting to see it again but it did not appear and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the March Hare was said to live I’ve seen hatters before she said to herself the March Hare will be much the most interesting and perhaps as this is May it won’t be raving madat least not so mad as it was in March As she said this she looked up and there was the Cat again sitting on a branch of a tree
Did you say pig or fig ? said the Cat
I said pig replied Alice and I wish you wouldn’t keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly you make one quite giddy
All right said the Cat and this time it vanished quite slowly beginning with the end of the tail and ending with the grin which remained some time after the rest of it had gone
Well ! I’ve often seen a cat without a grin thought Alice but a grin without a cat ! It’s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life !
She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the March Hare she thought it must be the right house because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur It was so large a house that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom and raised herself to about two feet high even then she walked up towards it rather timidly saying to herself Suppose it should be raving mad after all ! I almost wish I’d gone to see the Hatter instead !
